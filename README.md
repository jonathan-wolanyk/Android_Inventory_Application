# Android Inventory Application

<h3> Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? </h3>
This application is meant to address the needs of small business owners who have trouble tracking and managing their inventory. For instance, warehouse owners may need to easily access and modify their current inventory to have business operations continue smoothly.

<h3> What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? </h3>
This application utilizes two databases; one for user login credentials and another for inventory management. The main page of the application is the inventory screen, since that is the core purpose of the application. From the inventory page, users can add, remove, or modify items in the database to reflect their current inventory values. I believe the design is successful, because it provides a simple and easy way to support business operations.

<h3> How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future? </h3>
I developed my application in a way that supported user needs primarily. By developing the application from the ground up to support user needs, the end result was quite useful for inventory management in a realistic way. Slowing down inventory tracking and management was the main attribute to avoid, and I feel as though this was accomplished in the final product.

<h3> How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal? </h3>
The product was tested through static testing as well as functional testing by users and the developer on personal and emulated devices.
